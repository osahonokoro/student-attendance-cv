# Student Attendance System using Computer Vision  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project leverages **computer vision** and **IoT** to automate student attendance tracking in educational institutions. Using **Raspberry Pi** and **YOLO-based person detection**, the system captures student entries, verifies their identities, and notifies parents in real-time.  

## 🔥 Features  
- **Automated Attendance Tracking**: Detects and logs student presence using facial recognition.  
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Sends attendance updates to parents via an alert system.  
- **Edge Computing with Raspberry Pi**: Processes images locally for efficient performance.  
- **Secure Database Integration**: Stores attendance records in a centralized database.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, YOLO (You Only Look Once)  
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Camera Module  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Database**: Firebase / MySQL (planned)  

## 🛠️ Installation
